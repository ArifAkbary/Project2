OOPS :
1:Object;
2:Class;
3:inheritance;
4:polymorphism;
5:abstraction;
6:encapsulation;

We know what is class  and what is object for example car is class and toyota is object
human is class ahmad is object maryam is object of human

method:is a block of code that express the behaviours of a class , we can archive method in two type in java
1:overloading 2:over ridding;
method contains details which called attributed and behaviours which is action .

we can create our method by name of the method open and close () and open and close {}
if we do have some data type inside of () it is called arguments method if we don have any things like empty it is optional
is called non argument method .
method can be return type and can be un return type which is called void ;

varibles :
we have there kind of variable in java
1:instance variables
2:local variables ;
3:static variable

instance variable are those variable which is inside of class but out side of block of code method or constructor
local variable are those variable which are inside of class and also inside of block of code method or constructor
static variables  came with key word static make our variable stable and static one action

access modifiers and non access modifiers  in  java
we use access modifier to our object method and in our class to make access for others some method must be private and protected
in order to be access
we have 4 kind of these access modifiers
1:public ;
2:private;
3:protected ;
4:default;

public is work in all of our project
private is just work and access in our class that we are working on
protected is work and access in same package class and sub class that we are working on
defult is crate by compiler if we don't have any of three modifiers

constructor is also like method with a little bite different , is also a block of code which initialize  the behaviour  of a class
and it create automatically  by compiler  , when we crate or object
construct name must be the same name of  a class
constructor dons not have any return type even void
we have two kind of constructor non agreements constructor and parametrize constructor

we can create our constructor by name of the class and name of constructor open and close ()
if we do have any data type inside of () it is parameterize constructor othe wise it is non arguments constructor


Inheritance :
inheritance is a machnism which transfer the behaviours and method which created in parents class to child class with
extend key word while when we create the child class
we have four kind of inheritance in java
1:single inheritance;
2:artarchucl inheritance;
3:multilevel inheritance;
4:multiple  inheritance
1 class A {} calls b extand class A{}
2 class A{}  class b extand class A {} class c extand class A{}
3: class A{}  class b extand A {}  classs c extand b    {}   class e extand  c{}
4: class A{}   CLASS B{}    CLASS C EXTAND A /B

Super key reffer to immediate behaviors and method of parent class to call for child class


over loading and over ridding

when we have same name and different parameters method in our class we can over load this method easy in java
when we have same name and same parameters method in-our class we can  over riding this kind of method ;

when can do overloading by there type
changing the data type of parameters
changing the sequence or order of data type
changing of the data type to different data type

method with the final key
and main method can not be over riding in or class
if somethings is not inherited we can not do over ridding

Polymorphism
polymorphism it came from two word ploy it means multi and morphism  means form which one object can be in different form
polymorphism achive  in two part is called static polymorphism and dynamic polymorphism
what is polymorphism
polymorphism is the ability of a method to behave differently
depending upon object or parameters that we pass to a method.

how can we create polymorphism
1->>>> first make sure we have over load or over ridd our method
2>>>>>create a relationships between parents class and child class
3>>>>> by help of loop and array make our polymorphism and call them all the method that we do have in child and parent class

Abstraction:
is also  pillar and the 5th  number of OOPS;
it hide the implementation details and show us just the functionality  details for example sending sms or working on computer
or play a game in our play station

is also we can call this a blue print and map for our class to get easy coding more flexible and readability  coding in our
class we do use and need all 4 type of OOPS and abstraction also

how can we achive  abstraction
we can achive  by two type
1: abstraction class
2: interface

1: abstract class that all the class that we all woking is supe is call abstract and we do have that undr order of this
class is concrete class
example we do have a account number with WellsFARGOD
well fargo account is abstract ,chickening ,saving  ,debt  card  visas card all is concrete class

if there is class to class that is call inherited which we can extend
if there is class to interface is called interface implemented
if there is interface to interface is called extend it too


 Encapsulation:
 Encapsulation is one of the four fundamental OOP concepts.

 as clear the name of this it is like capsols that contains inside all nessery information that is usefull for or class
  Encapsulation in Java is a mechanism for wrapping the data (variables) and code acting on the data (methods) together as a single unit.

or getting together of all state and behivors in single unit or in new container is called encapsulation;

to create a class with encapsulation we must make highest access to our varible which is private like height security
and now we can wrape or data
and then provide setter and getter method to our varibles
when can click right and make our setter and getter

we can type or block of code and if statements or other void that we want to return in getter and we can call the same name
of the method on main method by setter
